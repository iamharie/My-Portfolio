                  I am pleased to provide a recommendation for Hariharan Mohan,
                  whose tenure as a Student Assistant transitioning to a
                  Graduate Research Assistant has showcased his potential as a
                  valuable addition to any organization or program. Throughout
                  this period, I have observed firsthand his development and
                  maturation as a Software Engineer. I was his project manager
                  and together we have completed many telecommunication projects
                  within the given deadlines. Hari stood out to be a highly
                  competent, possessing good analytical, oral, and written
                  communication skills. I particularly appreciate his leadership
                  quality reflected through good coordination with fellow team
                  members. I have observed his improvement in ability of
                  decision making. He also proved to be efficient working
                  independently. Hari has been an excellent employee and has
                  showcased his abilities to work for any organization with
                  great efficiency. He would be an ideal candidate and a
                  wonderful addition to your firm. Hence, I would recommend him
